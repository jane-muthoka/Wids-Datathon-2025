# Wids Datthon 2025
## Focus: Brain health 
In this year’s WiDS Datathon, participants will be tasked with building a model to predict both an individual’s sex and their ADHD diagnosis using functional brain imaging data of children and adolescents and their socio-demographic, emotions, and parenting information

## Challenge Question and Task:
“What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD; are they different between males and females, and, if so, how?”

The task is to create a *multi-outcome model to predict two separate target variables*: 1) ADHD (1=yes or 0=no) and 2) female (1=yes or 0=no).

For more information see the following video: Statistical Approaches on Vectorized Connectomes for Brain-Behavior Mapping

## Why is this important?
Tools of this nature can help identify individuals who may be at risk of ADHD, which can be difficult to diagnose particularly in females. 
Importantly, they help shed light on the parts of the brain relevant to ADHD in females and males, which in turn could lead to improvements in personalized medicine and therapies. Identifying ADHD early and designing therapies targeting specific brain mechanisms in a personalized way can greatly improve the mental health of affected individuals.

## Data Science Skills Developed:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing for model development and analysis
2. Understanding correlations
3. Regression model selection (statistical, machine learning)
4. Regression model fitting/testing (cross validation, avoiding over/underfitting, stratification of data during training)
5. Explaining factors that drive the performance of the model
6. Multi-outcome prediction
